Tic-Tac-Toe played within Tic-Tac-Toe

In order to run this program, download all the files and run from within Xcode.

The game is played simply:

1) The first player (X) may click on any square to make their first move

2) From there whichever square the first player selected determines in which smaller board the next player will play

3) Play goes back and forth between players

4) A player wins if they are able to win three of the smaller boards in standard tic-tac-toe fashion
