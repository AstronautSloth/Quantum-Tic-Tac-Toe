# Quantum-Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe played within Tic-Tac-Toe

In order to run this program, download all the files and run from within Xcode.

The game is played as follows:

1) The first player (X) may click on any square to make their first move

2) From there whichever square the player selected determines in which smaller board the next player will play
  
    Ex: If the first player selected a box in the top right of a smaller board, 
        the next player will make their move in the top right board

3) Play goes back and forth between players

4) A player wins if they are able to win three of the smaller boards in standard tic-tac-toe fashion

*Ties in smaller boards do not count for either player* -- This can be changed by modifying how the program checks for which player wins in what board but will take a bit of time to do.

Feel free to play around with the code, interface, or program logic as you see fit.
